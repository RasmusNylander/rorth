# Rorth

It's like [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth) but written in Rust! At least I think so, I don't actually know
since I have not programmed in Porth, but Porth is a stack-based programming language for computers and Rorth might also
turn out to be a stack-based programming language. In any case, Rorth will definitely be for computers.

## Plans for Rorth

Currently Rorth is planned to be:

- [x] For computers
- [ ] Compiled
- [ ] Native
- [ ] Turing-complete
- [ ] Statically typed
- [ ] Testable
- [ ] Self-hosted
- [ ] Useful[^usefulFootnote]
- [ ] Optimised
- [ ] Cross-platform[^Cross-platformFootnote]

Roth might be:

- [ ] Stack-based
- [ ] Object-oriented
- [ ] Functional
- [ ] Something with concurrency

[^usefulFootnote]: What exactly this means has yet to be decided.
[^Cross-platformFootnote]: This might be achieved by compiling down to LLVM.
